# PostgreSQL Backup & Recovery Runbook

## Scope

This runbook covers the production PostgreSQL recovery drill for PRODX POS.

The database remains the authoritative source of truth for transactional data. Browser/local JSON exports are not a substitute for database backup and restore.

## Backup mechanism

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/postgres-recovery-drill.yml` performs a read-only logical backup with:

```text
pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner --no-acl
```

The source connection is supplied only through the GitHub Actions secret:

```text
PRODX_PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL
```

No database credential is stored in the repository.

## Restore verification

The workflow restores the dump into an ephemeral PostgreSQL 16 instance and fails on restore errors.

It then verifies:

1. the public schema can be queried;
2. the `schema_migrations` table exists;
3. the restored migration table is readable.

A successful workflow run is required before a restore drill can be treated as verified.

## Evidence required for Production Readiness

A real production recovery drill must record:

- exact source database/environment;
- dump start/end time;
- dump size;
- restore start/end time;
- restore duration;
- restored migration count;
- workflow run URL and commit SHA;
- operator/date;
- observed RPO and RTO.

Do not invent RPO/RTO targets or claim recovery readiness from the existence of this workflow alone.

## Backup layers

This logical dump is one recovery layer. Production PostgreSQL must also have an infrastructure-native backup/PITR mechanism appropriate to the hosting provider.

The application repository cannot prove provider-side PITR configuration without provider evidence.

## Failure handling

If the drill fails:

1. keep the failure visible;
2. inspect the exact database/restore error;
3. fix the root cause;
4. rerun the drill;
5. retain the successful run as evidence.

Never skip the restore step or mark a failed backup as successful.
